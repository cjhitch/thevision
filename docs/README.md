# Portfolio Proposal

This proposal is intended to identify multiple questions and answers about creating a new portfolio website for myself using my LLC Visionary Creatives

## Expected Audience

This will be a free-lance portfolio website. Looking back at my previous clients I have found that the typical client base I have had has been men in their late 30s to early 50s. In most scenarios I have been dealing directly with the owner of the business or rarely another person who works directly under the boss. In either case this has typically been the decision maker both for monetary concerns as well as development and design decisions.

Most often the business is existing and already has a website. They often come looking for either a website or application. They typically if the former, need a facelift on the site, additional functionality, or the ability to drive more traffic, sometimes all of the above. Applications typically are brand new and pointed specifically at a new feature they would like to have implemented.

With the often lack of knowledge they typically come with few resources and a vague idea of what they want. After some questions I am typically able to determine what content and resources will be needed and what their intent is. As they normally come lacking here, they often need help implementing and getting content. These clients also typically require some design work as well.

## Objective

The objective of this new portfolio site is to serve as new marketing material for Visionary Creatives (my company - I already have my LLC, DBA, and EIN). This site will focus on how we partner with the target audience to bring a solution to their need. It will illustrate how we take that portion our of their hands to free them up to focus on their expertise. I would like to drive home the idea that we can provide assistance with things like optimization, SEO, accessibility, and brand development alongside the application and website creation.

## Tech Stack

- Next.js
- React.js
- Express.js
- Node.js
- Redux (possibly) - This may potentially be useContext and providers instead
- Bootstrap (possibly) - most development as of late has just been components with CSS Grid
- Sequelize
- Database - Unsure if I need to host this or can be run through vercel - Additional research needed
- Hosting: Vercel with thevisioncreatives.com domain
